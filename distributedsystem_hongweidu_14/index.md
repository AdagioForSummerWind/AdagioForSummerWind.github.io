## 2.System Model
- Difficulties for and threats to distributed systems
    - Widely varying mode of use
    - Wide range of system environments
    - Internal threats
    - External threats
- Physical Model
    - Three generations of distributed systems and the emergence of ultra-large-scale (ULS) distributed systems.
- Architectural Model 
    - An architectural model of a distributed system simplifies and abstracts the functions of the individual components of a distributed system
    - Entities that are communicating in the distributed system 
        - 进程、线程、传感器节点或者说对象、组件、网页服务
    - Types of communication paradigms:
        - Interprocess communication
        - Remote invocation
        - Indirect communication
            - Group communication
                - Broadcast (message sent to everyone)
                - Multicast (message sent to specific group)
                - Used for:
                    - Replication of services
                    - Replication of data
                    - Service discovery
                    - Event notification
            - Publish-subscribe-systems
                - Communication through propagation of events
                - Generally associated with publish/subscribe systems
                - Sender process publishes events
                - Receiver process subscribes to events and receives only the ones it is interested in
            - Message queues
    - Architectural styles: 
        - client-server：it scales poorly 
            - Decomposed a typical client-server application into three logical parts
                - the interface part.
                - the application logic part, and.
                - the data part.
            - Thin client implementation
                - Provides a minimal user interface layer, and leave everything else to the server.
            - Fat client implementation
                - Include all of the user interface and application logic in the client.
                - Rely only on the server to store and provide access to data.
            - Implementations in between will split up the interface or application logic parts over the clients and server in different ways.
        - peer-to-peer
            - Is composed of a large number of peer processes running on separate computers.
            - All processes have client and server roles.
            - Patterns of communication between them depends entirely on application requirements.
            - Storage, processing and communication loads for accessing objects are distributed across computers and network links.
            - Each object is replicated in several computers to further distribute the load and to provide resilience in the event of disconnection of individual computers.
            - Need to place and retrieve individual computers is more complex then in client-server architecture.
                - placement one:Servers partition a set of objects in which the service is based and distribute them between themselves.
                - placement two:Server maintain replicated copies of them on several hosts.
    - Vertical distribution (Multi-Tier) and horizontal distribution of c/s systems in Architectural patterns
        - Middleware:Is a layer of software whose purpose is to mask heterogeneity and to provide a convenient programming model to application programmers.
        - Vertical Distribution (Multi-Tier):
            - An extension of the client-server architecture.
            - Distributes the traditional server functionality over multiple servers.
        - Horizontal Distribution:
            - Involves replicating a server’s functionality over multiple computers.
            - Typical example: replicated Web server
                - Each server machine contains a complete copy of all hosted Web pages.
                - Client requests are passed on to the servers in a round robin fashion.
            - Is used to improve scalability (by reducing the load on individual servers) and reliability (by providing redundancy)
- Fundamental Model
    - Characteristics of synchronous distributed systems and asynchronous distributed system(Interaction model)
        - Two variants of the interaction model:
        - Synchronous distributed systems
            - The following bounds are defined:
                - The time to execute each step of a process has known lower and upper bounds
                - Each message transmitted over a channel is received within a known bounded time.
                - Each process has a local clock whose drift rate from real time has known bound.
        - Asynchronous distributed system:
            - There are no bounds on:
                - Process execution speed
                - Message transmission delays
                - Clock drift rate
    - Failure model
    - Security model
## 3.Physical Clock Synchronization
Adjustment changes slope of system time: Linear compensating function （线性补偿函数）
### 3.1Cristian’s algorithm:

### 3.2Berkeley Algorithm: 
synchronize a set of clocks as close as possible

## 4.NTP Symmetric mode
- 如何计算偏移量、准确值、延迟、传输时间。
- used to synchronize between the time servers (peer-peer)
- There can be a non-negligible delay between the arrival of one message and the dispatch of the next
- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QizhengZou/Image_hosting_rep/main/20220102150951.png)
- Delay = total transmission time of the two messages
$$d_i = (T_i – T_{i-3} ) – (T_{i-1}– T_{i-2})$$
- Offset of clock A relative to clock B:  
    - Offset of clock A: $o_i =((T_{i-2} – T_{i-3} ) + ( T_{i-1} – T_i))/2$
    - Accuracy bound: $d_i /2$

## 5.Logical Clock Synchronization:
- Event ordering: happened before (->), concurrent (||)
- Lamport’s algorithm: single timestamp clock synchronization & features 
    - If a -> b then V(a) < V(b)
    - The reverse is not always true
- Timestamp vector synchronization and features
    - a -> b iff V(a) < V(b)
    - a || b iff neither V(a) ≤ V(b) nor V(b) ≤ V(a)
- Application of timestamp vectors: causal ordered multicast

## 10.Data Centric Consistency Models
- consistency---description
- Strict---**Absolute time ordering** of all shared accesses matters.
- Linearizability---All processes must see all shared accesses in the **same order**. Accesses are furthermore ordered according to a (nonunigue) global timestamp
- Sequential---All processes see all shared accesses in the **same order**. Accesses are not ordered in time
- Causal---All processes see **causally-related** shared accesses in the same order.
- FIFO---All processes see writes from each other **in the order they were used**. Writes from different processes may not always be seen in that order
- Consistency models **not using synchronization** operations.

- Weak---Shared data can be counted on to be consistent **only after a synchronization** is done
- Release---Shared data are made consistent when a **critical region is exited**
- Entry---Shared data **pertaining to a critical region** are made consistent when a **critical region is entered.**
- Models **with synchronization** operations.

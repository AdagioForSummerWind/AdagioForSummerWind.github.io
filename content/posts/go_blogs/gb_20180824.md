# Go 1.11 is released

Andrew Bonventre  
24 August 2018

Who says releasing on Friday is a bad idea?

Today the Go team is happy to announce the release of Go 1.11. You can get it from the [download page](https://go.dev/dl/).

There are many changes and improvements to the toolchain, runtime, and libraries, but two features stand out as being especially exciting: modules and WebAssembly support.

This release adds preliminary support for a [new concept called “modules,”](https://go.dev/doc/go1.11#modules) an alternative to GOPATH with integrated support for versioning and package distribution. Module support is considered experimental, and there are still a few rough edges to smooth out, so please make liberal use of the [issue tracker](https://go.dev/issue/new).

Go 1.11 also adds an experimental port to [WebAssembly](https://go.dev/doc/go1.11#wasm) (`js/wasm`). This allows programmers to compile Go programs to a binary format compatible with four major web browsers. You can read more about WebAssembly (abbreviated “Wasm”) at [webassembly.org](https://webassembly.org/) and see [this wiki page](https://go.dev/wiki/WebAssembly) on how to get started with using Wasm with Go. Special thanks to [Richard Musiol](https://github.com/neelance) for contributing the WebAssembly port!

We also want to thank everyone who contributed to this release by writing code, filing bugs, providing feedback, and/or testing the betas and release candidates. Your contributions and diligence helped to ensure that Go 1.11 is as bug-free as possible. That said, if you do notice any problems, please [file an issue](https://go.dev/issues/new).

For more detail about the changes in Go 1.11, see the [release notes](https://go.dev/doc/go1.11).

Have a wonderful weekend and enjoy the release!

Today the Go team is very happy to announce the release of Go 1.14. You can get it from the [download page](https://go.dev/dl).

Some of the highlights include:

- [Embedding interfaces with overlapping method sets](https://go.dev/doc/go1.14#language)
- [Improved defer performance](https://go.dev/doc/go1.14#runtime)
- [Goroutines are asynchronously preemptible](https://go.dev/doc/go1.14#runtime)
- [The page allocator is more efficient](https://go.dev/doc/go1.14#runtime)
- [Internal timers are more efficient](https://go.dev/doc/go1.14#runtime)

For the complete list of changes and more information about the improvements above, see the [**Go 1.14 release notes**](https://go.dev/doc/go1.14).

We want to thank everyone who contributed to this release by writing code, filing bugs, providing feedback, and/or testing the beta and release candidate. Your contributions and diligence helped to ensure that Go 1.14 is as stable as possible. That said, if you notice any problems, please [file an issue](https://go.dev/issue/new).

# First Class Functions in Go

Andrew Gerrand  
30 June 2011

Programmers new to Go are often surprised by its support for function types, functions as values, and closures. The [First Class Functions in Go](https://go.dev/doc/codewalk/functions/) code walk demonstrates these features with a simulation of the dice game [Pig](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice)). It is a pretty program that uses the language to great effect, and a fun read for Go beginners and veterans alike.

More resources are available at [golang.org](https://go.dev/doc/docs.html).

# Getting to know the Go community

Andrew Gerrand  
21 December 2011

Over the past couple of years Go has attracted a lot of users and contributors, and I’ve had a great time meeting and talking with many of you. However, for every Gopher I know there are dozens I know nothing about. In order to address this imbalance I’ve prepared a survey for Go users everywhere.

The survey is short. It asks about you, your involvement with Go, and your interest in Go-related events. Among other things, this data will help myself and the rest of the Go team plan future Go events and schedule conference appearances.

Please take a minute to [complete the survey now](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&formkey=dFdxOTU1Mm92VFA3eHdkekFPamJjUnc6MQ#gid=0).

Thanks!

Andrew

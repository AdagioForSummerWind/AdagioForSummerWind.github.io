# Concurrency is not parallelism

Andrew Gerrand  
16 January 2013

If there’s one thing most people know about Go, is that it is designed for concurrency. No introduction to Go is complete without a demonstration of its goroutines and channels.

But when people hear the word _concurrency_ they often think of _parallelism_, a related but quite distinct concept. In programming, concurrency is the _composition_ of independently executing processes, while parallelism is the simultaneous _execution_ of (possibly related) computations. Concurrency is about _dealing with_ lots of things at once. Parallelism is about _doing_ lots of things at once.

To clear up this conflation, Rob Pike gave a talk at [Heroku](http://heroku.com/)’s Waza conference entitled [_Concurrency is not parallelism_](https://blog.heroku.com/concurrency_is_not_parallelism), and a video recording of the talk was released a few months ago.

# Go 1.19 is released!

The Go Team  
2 August 2022

Today the Go team is thrilled to release Go 1.19, which you can get by visiting the [download page](https://go.dev/dl/).

Go 1.19 refines and improves our massive [Go 1.18 release](https://go.dev/blog/go1.18) earlier this year. We focused Go 1.19’s generics development on addressing the subtle issues and corner cases reported to us by the community, as well as important performance improvements (up to 20% for some generic programs).

Doc comments now support [links, lists, and clearer heading syntax](https://go.dev/doc/comment). This change helps users write clearer, more navigable doc comments, especially in packages with large APIs. As part of this change `gofmt` now reformats doc comments to apply a standard formatting to uses of these features. See “[Go Doc Comments](https://go.dev/doc/comment)” for all the details.

[Go’s memory model](https://go.dev/ref/mem) now explicitly defines the behavior of the [sync/atomic package](https://go.dev/pkg/sync/atomic/). The formal definition of the happens-before relation has been revised to align with the memory models used by C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Rust, and Swift. Existing programs are unaffected. Along with the memory model update, there are [new types in the sync/atomic package](https://go.dev/doc/go1.19#atomic_types), such as [atomic.Int64](https://go.dev/pkg/sync/atomic/#Int64) and [atomic.Pointer\[T\]](https://go.dev/pkg/sync/atomic/#Pointer), to make it easier to use atomic values.

For [security reasons](https://go.dev/blog/path-security), the os/exec package no longer respects relative paths in PATH lookups. See the [package documentation](https://go.dev/pkg/os/exec/#hdr-Executables_in_the_current_directory) for details. Existing uses of [golang.org/x/sys/execabs](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/sys/execabs) can be moved back to os/exec in programs that only build using Go 1.19 or later.

The garbage collector has added support for a soft memory limit, discussed in detail in [the new garbage collection guide](https://go.dev/doc/gc-guide#Memory_limit). The limit can be particularly helpful for optimizing Go programs to run as efficiently as possible in containers with dedicated amounts of memory.

The new build constraint `unix` is satisfied when the target operating system (`GOOS`) is any Unix-like system. Today, Unix-like means all of Go’s target operating systems except `js`, `plan9`, `windows`, and `zos`.

Finally, Go 1.19 includes a wide variety of performance and implementation improvements, including dynamic sizing of initial goroutine stacks to reduce stack copying, automatic use of additional file descriptors on most Unix systems, jump tables for large switch statements on x86-64 and ARM64, support for debugger-injected function calls on ARM64, register ABI support on RISC-V, and experimental support for Linux running on Loongson 64-bit architecture LoongArch (`GOARCH=loong64`).

Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release by writing code, filing bugs, sharing feedback, and testing the beta and release candidates. Your efforts helped to ensure that Go 1.19 is as stable as possible. As always, if you notice any problems, please [file an issue](https://go.dev/issue/new).

Enjoy Go 1.19!

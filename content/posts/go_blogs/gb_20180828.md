# Go 2 Draft Designs

28 August 2018

Yesterday, at our annual Go contributor summit, attendees got a sneak peek at preliminary _drafts_ of possible designs for changes to error handling and generics. [The development of Go 2](https://blog.golang.org/toward-go2) was announced last year and we are excited to share updates with you today.

For a quick overview, watch this short message we just played at Gophercon 2018:

We invite everyone in the Go community to [learn more about the designs](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/go2draft.md) and help us improve them.

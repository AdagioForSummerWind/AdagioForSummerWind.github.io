# Learn Go from your browser

Andrew Gerrand  
4 October 2011

We are excited to announce [A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/), a guided tour of the Go programming language you can run from your browser.

The tour is hands-on, demonstrating the language through code samples that you can modify, compile, and run from the tour itself. (The technology behind the [Go Playground](https://go.dev/doc/play/) does the work.)

The tour has three sections. The first section covers basic syntax and data structures; the second discusses methods and interfaces; and the third introduces Go’s concurrency primitives. Each section concludes with a few exercises so you can practice what you’ve learned.

So, what are you waiting for? [Get started now!](https://go.dev/tour/)

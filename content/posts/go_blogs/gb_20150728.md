# GopherCon 2015 Roundup

Andrew Gerrand  
28 July 2015

A few weeks ago, Go programmers from around the world descended on Denver, Colorado for GopherCon 2015. The two-day, single-track conference attracted more than 1,250 attendees—nearly double last year’s number—and featured 22 talks presented by Go community members.

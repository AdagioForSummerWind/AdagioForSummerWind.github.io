# Go at Google I/O and Gopher SummerFest

Francesc Campoy  
6 October 2014

## Introduction

The week of June 23rd was a good week for gophers in San Francisco. Go was a big part of [Google I/O](https://www.google.com/events/io) on Wednesday and Thursday, and on Monday we took advantage of the large gopher population to run the [Go SummerFest](http://www.meetup.com/golangsf/events/170421402/), a special instance of the [GoSF](http://www.meetup.com/golangsf) meetup. This blog post is a recap of both events.

## Gopher SummerFest

On the Monday, more than 200 gophers gathered at the Google office in San Francisco to hear a series of talks:

- The State of Go, ([slides](https://docs.google.com/a/golang.org/file/d/0B-nws9GU_6qVQm9tdncxWnJGUTQ/edit) and [video](http://www.hakkalabs.co/articles/state-go)) by Andrew Gerrand.
- I was wrong, again! ([slides](https://docs.google.com/a/golang.org/file/d/0B-nws9GU_6qVTTUwS25qaFlzMGs/edit) and [video](http://www.hakkalabs.co/articles/why-we-use-go)), by Derek Collison.
- Go at Splice ([slides](https://docs.google.com/a/golang.org/file/d/0B-nws9GU_6qVZklnNnJITlhSbXc/edit)), by Matt Aimonetti
- Quick testing with quick ([slides](https://docs.google.com/a/golang.org/file/d/0B-nws9GU_6qVVElmOHpwamp4aTA/edit)), by Evan Shaw
- Something about Go (no slides), by Blake Mizerany.

## Go at Google I/O

On the Wednesday and Thursday, Go was at Google I/O in two different formats: the Go booth in the sandbox area and the Go code labs available in the code lab area and all around the world through [I/O Extended](https://www.google.com/events/io/io-extended).

### The Go booth

The Go booth was part of the Developer Sandbox area.

For the two days of the conference, some gophers from Google and other companies gave a series of talks and demonstrations. The talks were not recorded, but the slides and some screencasts and blog posts will be shared soon.

We also organized Q&A sessions and lightning talks by members of the Go community:

- [Sugu Sougoumarane](https://twitter.com/ssougou) talked about how [vitess](https://github.com/youtube/vitess) solved scalability problems at YouTube. ([video](https://youtu.be/midJ6b1LkA0))

### The Go code lab

This year attendees of Google I/O had a code lab area with self-service computers where they could sit and learn Go. The code labs were also available to anyone through the Google I/O extended brand. You can try it yourself at [io2014codelabs.appspot.com](https://io2014codelabs.appspot.com/).

# Go and the Google Cloud Platform

Andrew Gerrand  
12 June 2013

## Introduction

In 2011 we announced the [Go runtime for App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/go/overview). Since then, we have continued to improve the Go App Engine experience, and generally improved Go support for the Google Cloud Platform. For instance, the [google-api-go-client](http://code.google.com/p/google-api-go-client) provides a Go interface to a range of Google’s public APis, including Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Drive, and many more.

Learn more by watching these talks from Google I/O this year:

## High Performance Apps with Go on App Engine

_The Go runtime for App Engine is a high performance engine for_ _running web applications. It produces fast responses,_ _starts instances in a fraction of a second, makes the most use_ _of instance hours, and allows your app to do serious processing_ _at full machine speed._ _Come along to hear how to fully exploit the power of Go on App_ _Engine and make your web applications the best they can be._

## All the Ships in the World

Visualizing Data with Google Cloud and Maps

_Tens of thousands of ships report their position at least once_ _every 5 minutes, 24 hours a day._ _Visualizing that quantity of data and serving it out to large_ _numbers of people takes lots of power both in the browser and on the server._ _This session will explore the use of Maps,_ _App Engine, Go, Compute Engine, BigQuery, Cloud Storage,_ _and WebGL to do massive data visualization._
